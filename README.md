The Lemoncello Hotel Site: This page is an example home page for a hotel.  It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Movie Theater Site:  This page is an example home page for a movie theater that is styled utilizing Bootstrap 4.  It contains many Bootstrap components including, but not limited to, a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.

Vintage Car Dealership Site: This webpage is an example site for a vintage Porsche dealership.  It is styled with CSS and JavaScript.  I utilized a navbar from Bootstrap, implemented smooth scrolling, included a carousel for images, as well as a pop-out contact box.
